scribus_archives
================

These repos stores lost patches, scribus versions, repos or files.


Some people have been wanting to work on some complex issue as RTL and indic, and their patch, allthough somehow working ok,  has not been merged into core svn, due to various issues.

Their code is generally spread all over the net on various repos. These github repo is a directory of these places and a chest to keep the codes for future reference and use by other devs.
